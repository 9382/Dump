# PythonObfuscator (Unfinished)

This follows the same idea as LuaObfuscator, which is to be able to parse and execute a string as python code *without* using exec. Note that this module is in progress and is not in a finished state by any standard, and versions can expected to be broken or unfinished

## Info

Some more info on each of the files

### ASTExecutor.py

This is the base how-to-run-it file, designed to parse something ran through python's `ast.parse`. There is no element of obfuscation here, and this is purely to get a start footing before attempting anything. The progress on elements being implemented are available in the script, which lists the implementation status of different expressions and statuses.
